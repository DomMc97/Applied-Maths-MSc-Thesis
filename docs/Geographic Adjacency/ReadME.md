## Methods.ipynb
A notebook which displays the GAM score minus the benchmark mu across Markov time for the three neighborhood methods Polygon, epsilon-ball with epsilon = 0.03 and k-nearest-neighbors with k = 6.

## Neighbors.ipynb
Notebook visualising the differences between the 3 geographical graph construction methods Polygon, epsilon-ball with epsilon = 0.03 and k-nearest-neighbors with k = 6.

## GAM Across Time
Contains notebooks which plot the GAM score and the benchmark scores across Markov time for each of the three neighborhood methods Polygon, epsilon-ball with epsilon = 0.03 and k-nearest-neighbors with k = 6.
