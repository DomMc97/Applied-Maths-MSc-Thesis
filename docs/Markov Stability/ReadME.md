## Stability Plotter Files
Files containing code used for visualisation of the results of Markov Stability Community Detection (MSCD).

## longrun.mat
Results of the final run of MSCD ran directly in a MATLAB console. That is C a $n \times t$ matrix, where $n$ is the number of nodes and $t$ is the number of Markov times searched, containg the clusters found at each markov time. N an array of the number of clusters at each Markov time. S an array of the Stability at each Markov time. VI an array of the number of clusters at each Markov time. T an array of each Markov time searched.
