## CkNN
Files relating to the CkNN construction of the MSOA Cosine Similarity Graph. 

MSOA Distance File available on request.

constructNetworkStructure edited from here-https://github.com/DomMc97/GraphBasedClustering.

## Markov Stability
Markov Stability Community Detection was ran using code from here-https://github.com/DomMc97/GraphBasedClustering or https://github.com/michaelschaub/PartitionStability.
This was ran directly in a MATLAB console longrun.m is the result of the run.

Plotting code has been adapted from here-https://github.com/tarikaltuncu/AnalyseMS and here-https://github.com/scipy/scipy-cookbook/blob/master/ipython/SignalSmooth.ipynb.

## MSOA Data Prep
Files and a notebook relating to the cleaning and merging of data related to MSOAs and trust locations.

## GAM Classes
A set of classes written for the purpose of calculating GAM.

## Geographic Adjacency
Google Colab notebooks visualising and quantifting Geographic Adjacency Graph Construction techniques.

## Cluster Visualisations
Google Colab notebooks visualising and quantifting clusters and GAM for the 5 chosen clusters.

## Figures
