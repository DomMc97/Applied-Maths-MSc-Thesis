## CkNN
Files relating to the CkNN construction of the MSOA Cosine Similarity Graph. 

MSOA Distance File available on request.

constructNetworkStructure edited from here-https://github.com/DomMc97/GraphBasedClustering.

## Markov Stability
All code related to the plotting of Markov Stability Community Detection results.

Markov Stability Community Detection was ran using code from here-https://github.com/DomMc97/GraphBasedClustering or https://github.com/michaelschaub/PartitionStability.
This was ran directly in a MATLAB console longrun.m is the result of the run.

Plotting code has been adapted from here-https://github.com/tarikaltuncu/AnalyseMS and here-https://github.com/scipy/scipy-cookbook/blob/master/ipython/SignalSmooth.ipynb.

## MSOA Data Prep
Files and a notebook relating to the cleaning and merging of data related to MSOAs and hospital trust locations.

## GAM Classes
A set of classes written for the purpose of calculating GAM.

## Geographic Adjacency
Google Colab notebooks visualising and quantifting Geographic Adjacency Graph Construction techniques.

## Cluster Visualisations
Google Colab notebooks visualising and investigating the 5 chosen clusters including their GAM scores.

## Figures
All interactive figures used in body of the thesis. They can be found in the uploaded notebooks they are uploaded here for the purpose of hosting on github pages.
